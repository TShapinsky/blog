This project is an exercise in achieving a desired look through controlling different parts of the film photography process. Specifically I wanted to go for a white fluffy cloud on a black background. Similar to the image at the top of this page. 

## Current Status
I've paused working on this further due to the my testing conclusions being that I can't really get the look I want without using an infrared filter in addition to a polarizing filter. While I do have access to these filters and can theorhetically make these images, the film cameras I was using for this project have through-the-lens (TTL) viewfinders. Since my eyes can't see in infrared it is hard to frame and focus images without seeing through the lens. I do have some additional data I collected after the first post on the constrast effects of different filter combinations which I may post at some point.
